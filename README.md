This is a repository for a Full Stack MERN app.
For frontend it uses React, Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query. For backend, it uses Node, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

It might take a little bit long to get the data from the database the first time you load the app because of Render.com policy.
